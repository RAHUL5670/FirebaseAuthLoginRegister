📌 How to Upload a React Project to GitHub Using the Terminal
If you have a React project and want to upload it directly to GitHub using the terminal, follow these steps:

1️⃣ Initialize a Git Repository in Your React Project
First, open your React project in the terminal and run:

sh
Copy
Edit
git init
This initializes a Git repository in your project folder.

2️⃣ Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub

Click New Repository

Give your repository a name (e.g., my-react-app)

Select Public or Private

Do not initialize it with a README (we’ll add it manually)

Click Create Repository

After creating the repository, GitHub will give you a link (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/my-react-app.git).

3️⃣ Link Your React Project to GitHub
Run the following command in your terminal:

sh
Copy
Edit
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-react-app.git
This connects your local project to the remote GitHub repository.

4️⃣ Add Files and Commit
Now, add all project files and create a commit:

sh
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
💡 The . means "add all files."

5️⃣ Push Your Code to GitHub
Push your code to the GitHub repository:

sh
Copy
Edit
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
This will upload your React project to GitHub. 🎉

6️⃣ Verify Your Upload
Go to your GitHub repository and refresh the page. You should see all your project files.

7️⃣ (Optional) Add a README File
To add a README.md file:

sh
Copy
Edit
echo "# My React App" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added README"
git push origin main
✅ Done! Your React project is now on GitHub.
